For v1.04 - TODO
-----------------------

- Write a better arg parser/solution

NEW OPTIONS:
-a send arp requests (for class-c ip addresses only?)
-w for regular client connects? stdin timeouts?

-- write a connect() wrapper that takes in a timeout or something along those lines...
-- connecting to clients should be allowed to use a port range

-- get_pipes() might be better off passing in a pointer to a struct 
   so that it can return an error code instead
