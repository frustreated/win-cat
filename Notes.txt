For v1.04
-----------------------

-a send arp requests
-w timeout (in milliseconds)



-- format ping requests better
-- connect scans
    - sped up with non-blocking sockets successfully
-- write a connect() wrapper that takes in a timeout or somethind along those lines...
-- connecting to clients should be allowed to use a port range


hanging issue (to reproduce) :
    host A: wincat -l 8000
            wincat -l 8001
    host B: nc HOST_A_IP 8000-8001 < some_text_file

    -- seems to be hanging at ExitProcess()
        -- see msdn's notes about deadlocks caused by this function
