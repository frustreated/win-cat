For v1.04
-----------------------

NEW OPTIONS:
-a send arp requests (for class-c ip addresses only?)
-w timeout (in milliseconds)
-r (attempt reverse dns lookups)


-- connect scans
    - sped up with non-blocking sockets successfully
-- write a connect() wrapper that takes in a timeout or somethind along those lines...
-- connecting to clients should be allowed to use a port range

-- Clean up the server.c and client.c
-- Clean up the rest of the code
-- get_pipes() might be better off passing in a pointer to a struct 
   so that it can return an error code instead

BUGS:

select is not blocking when polling both read and write sets (100% of 1 cpu core == busy looping)
- Then again this might be expected behavior
